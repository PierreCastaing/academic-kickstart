I am a freelance developer based in Paris. I currently work with the Malt platform.

I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris and Columbia University a few years ago. For the last couple of years, I worked as a Data Scientist at Shift Technology, a french company providing a fraud detection tool powered by Machine Learning and displayed as a web interface for the end-clients. I was highly involve on the backend part of this tool. You can also check my other projects below.

I love to code and develop projects - for work or for myslef. I prefer projects that produce a nice outcome within a few weeks or months, rather than endlessly complex tentative that drag on for years. And I like job well done.
